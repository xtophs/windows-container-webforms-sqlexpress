   <h1>
      Welcome to the "TheBeerHouse" Starter Kit</h1>
   This Starter Kit was created as a sample project for the Wrox Press book <strong>"ASP.NET 2.0 Website
   Programming", by Marco Bellinaso.</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      TheBeerHouse site has everything a modern content-based site will have, including
      dynamic articles &amp; news, polls for user-to-site communication, forums for user-to-user
      communication, newsletters and RSS feeds to notify members about new content on
      the site, an e-commerce store for selling products online, homepage personalization
      and content localization.<br />
      <br />
      The "ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming" book follows a “Problem - Design - Solution”
      approach in each chapter: the Problem section explains the business requirements
      for the module designed in that chapter, the Design section is used to develop our
      roadmap for meeting those requirements, and the Solution section is where the code
      to implement the design is written. At the end of the book the reader will have
      created a real-world site with most of the features required by modern content-centric
      sites and e-commerce stores.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>If you want to learn everything about this Starter Kit, its design and all
         the implementation details, please take a look at the </strong><a href="http://www.dotnet2themax.com/booksmarco.aspx">

      <strong>Running the site</strong></h2>
   To run the site just press <strong>F5</strong> or click <strong>Debug | Start Debugging</strong>.<br />
   The sample administrator account has the following credentials: <strong>Username: Admin

   <h2>
      <strong>Notes</strong></h2>
   1) You need to add NTFS write permission to the Uploads folder, for the ASPNET (Windows
   2000 and XP) or the Network Service user account (Windows Server 2003).<br />
   2) Be sure to delete other sample account from the Admin / Manage Users page before
   going to production.<br />
